# Blood Bank Management

A new Flutter project created with FlutLab - [https://flutlab.io](https://flutlab.io)

This application is designed for managing blood bank operations, including user authentication, blood inventory, donor management, and potentially request handling. It utilizes Firebase for backend services.

## Getting Started

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

* [Flutter Documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs): Offers tutorials, samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
* [Flutter Codelab](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab): Provides hands-on experience with Flutter development.
* [Flutter Cookbook](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook): Contains recipe-style answers to common Flutter development questions.

### Getting Started with FlutLab

* **How to use FlutLab?** Please view the [FlutLab Documentation](https://flutlab.io/docs).
* **Join the discussion:** Connect with other FlutLab users on [FlutLab Residents](https://flutlab.io/residents).

## Firebase Integration

This project leverages Firebase for various backend functionalities, including:

* **Authentication:** Securely manages user sign-up and sign-in.
* **Database:** Stores and retrieves application data (e.g., blood inventory, donor information, requests).
* **(Other Firebase services you might be using, e.g., Firestore, Realtime Database, Cloud Storage)**

### Important Firebase Configuration Files

To run this application, you need to configure Firebase for your project. This involves the following files:

* **`firebase_options.dart`:** This file contains the necessary Firebase project configuration details for different platforms (Android, iOS, Web). You will typically generate this file using the FlutterFire CLI. **Ensure this file is included in your project's `lib` directory.**

* **`google-services.json` (for Android):** This file contains your Android Firebase project configuration. You download this file from your Firebase console and should place it in the `android/app` directory of your Flutter project.

* **`GoogleService-Info.plist` (for iOS/macOS):** This file contains your iOS/macOS Firebase project configuration. You download this file from your Firebase console and should place it in the `ios/Runner` directory (for iOS) or `macos/Runner` directory (for macOS) of your Flutter project.

* **`firebase-config.js` (for Web):** This file contains your web Firebase project configuration. You'll typically add this configuration directly within your `web/index.html` file or in a separate JavaScript file included in your web build.

**Note:** It is crucial to **not commit your `google-services.json`, `GoogleService-Info.plist`, and potentially your `firebase-config.js` files directly to your public repository** if they contain sensitive API keys. A common practice is to add these files to your `.gitignore` file and provide instructions on how to obtain and configure them locally.

## Installation

Provide clear and concise steps on how to set up and run your application. This might include:

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    * Flutter SDK installed on your machine.
    * Firebase project created in the Firebase console ([https://console.firebase.google.com/](https://console.firebase.google.com/)).
    * FlutterFire CLI installed (`dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli`).

2.  **Cloning the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Asmita1507/Blood_Bank_Management](https://github.com/Asmita1507/Blood_Bank_Management)
    cd Blood_Bank_Management
    ```

3.  **Setting up Firebase:**
    * Follow the instructions on the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) to add your Android, iOS, and/or web apps to your Firebase project.
    * Download the `google-services.json`, `GoogleService-Info.plist`, and obtain your web Firebase configuration.
    * Place the downloaded files in the correct directories as mentioned in the "Important Firebase Configuration Files" section.
    * Run the FlutterFire CLI to generate the `firebase_options.dart` file:
        ```bash
        flutterfire configure
        ```
        Select your Firebase project and the platforms you are targeting.

4.  **Getting Flutter dependencies:**
    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```

5.  **Running the application:**
    ```bash
    flutter run
    ```
